<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'><strong><font size=20>T</font></strong>ucked
away behind a velvet hill and a curtain of whispering willows, there was a
secret place that very few had ever seen. It was called <b>The Heart-Shaped
Garden</b>, and from above, its emerald borders curled into the perfect shape
of love—a great big heart.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>No
one knew who planted it, but the garden had been there for generations. Tall
trees grew along its edges, their trunks curved and leaning slightly inward, as
if embracing the space in the center. These weren’t ordinary trees—they were <b>Fruit
Trees of Wonder</b>, and each one grew a different fruit with magical flavors.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>One
tree bore glowing golden apples that tasted like honey and sunshine. Another
tree grew purple pears that giggled softly when picked. The lemon tree's fruit
sparkled with a silvery shimmer and made you sing when you bit into one.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>In
the middle of the garden stood an old wooden bench, half-covered in ivy, facing
a small sparkling pond. Next to the bench lived an old gardener named Mira. She
wasn’t very tall, but she had bright eyes that twinkled like stars. Mira had
been the <b>Guardian of the Garden</b> for as long as anyone could remember.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>Each
morning, she sang to the trees and watered their roots with dew collected from
morning mist. The garden listened to her songs, and in return, it bloomed
brighter each day.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>Children
from the nearby village had heard stories about the garden, but only those who
came with kindness in their hearts could find it. If your intentions were
selfish or greedy, the garden would vanish from sight, and you’d find only a
patch of dry grass.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>One
sunny afternoon, a little girl named Lila wandered through the woods with a
basket of wildflowers. She had no idea she was near the heart-shaped garden.
She just liked to hum while she picked flowers. As she walked through the
trees, the air began to shimmer, and suddenly, she stepped into a
clearing—right into the Heart-Shaped Garden.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>Mira
welcomed her with a smile. “You have the heart of a gardener,” she said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>Lila
spent the whole afternoon helping Mira pick fruit, sweep leaves, and laugh with
the pears. Before she left, Mira gave her a seed from the golden apple tree.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>“Plant
this where love is needed most,” Mira whispered.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>Years
later, gardens shaped like hearts began popping up in villages all over the
land. Each one full of magical trees, laughter, and love—gifts from the very
first garden, now shared with the world.</span></p>
