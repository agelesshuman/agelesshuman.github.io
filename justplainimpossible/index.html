1: The Wall</span></b></p></center>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'><strong><font size=20>J</font></strong>ohn
had always believed he was meant for more. But lately, all he could see was the
wall.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>It
wasn't a real wall, of course—not brick or steel—but it was just as solid.
Every time he tried to climb higher in life, it was there. Rejections, bills,
exhaustion, and that voice in his head whispering, <i>“You’re not good enough.”</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>At
34, John was stuck in a job he tolerated and a routine that numbed him. Dreams
of writing a book, starting a business, or even running a marathon had faded
into background noise. They all seemed... just plain impossible.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>But
then came the Tuesday that changed everything.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>It
was raining. He was soaked. Late again. His boss shot him the usual look of
disappointment. And something in John snapped—not with anger, but with clarity.
<i>“If everything feels impossible anyway,”</i> he thought, <i>“why not try the
thing I actually care about?”</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>Chapter
2: The Climb</span></b></p></center>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>John
started small. A single page of writing before bed. A morning jog, even if it
was just around the block. He made a list of impossible things—things he had
once dreamed of but shelved away. At the top of the list: <b>Write a book</b>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>He
didn’t tell anyone at first. He was too afraid they'd laugh, or worse—agree it
was impossible.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>But
he kept going. One page turned into ten. Then twenty. Some days were rough. The
voice still showed up, saying, <i>“Who do you think you are?”</i> But now John
talked back.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>He
met people online chasing their own impossible. A woman learning to walk again
after a car accident. A dad going back to college at 50. A teenager building a
solar car from scrap. They reminded him: <i>“Impossible” is just what the world
calls it before you do it.</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>John
hit roadblocks. Writer's block. Self-doubt. A hard drive crash that nearly
wiped out everything. But he pressed on. Because every time he wanted to quit,
he’d ask himself, <i>“Why did I even start?”</i> And the answer always came
back clear: <i>Because I couldn’t stand not trying.</i></span></p>

<div class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;
text-align:center;line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>Chapter
3: The Leap</span></b></p></center>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>Two
years later, John stood at the front of a small bookstore. He held the first
copy of his book in his hands. Not a bestseller. Not perfect. But real.
Finished. His.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>As
he spoke to the modest crowd gathered to hear him talk, he saw the same look in
their eyes that he once had in his own—<i>That’s amazing... but I could never
do that.</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>He
smiled. “You think it’s just plain impossible,” he told them. “I used to think
that too. But impossible is just what it looks like <i>before</i> it’s done.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>He
paused, scanning the room, hoping the message landed. “Start with something
tiny. Start scared. Start unprepared. Just <i>start</i>. You’ll surprise
yourself.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>And
with that, John walked off the tiny stage, not as a man who had done the
impossible, but as one who had simply done what he loved—and proved that
sometimes, <i>just plain impossible</i> is anything but.</span></p>
