1: The Map Arrives</span></b></p></center>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'><strong><font size=20>I</font></strong>t
was a Tuesday. Not just any Tuesday—one of those too-blue-sky,
birds-singing-too-much kinds of Tuesdays. April was eating her peanut butter
toast upside down on the couch (because it was Opposite Day in her mind), when
the map slipped through the mail slot. It didn’t land like regular mail. No
soft thump. This one <i>sang.</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>“Wheeeeee!”
it cried as it glided in and spun three times before landing on her lap. April
blinked. Toast forgotten, she opened the scroll. It was made of shimmer-paper,
the kind that seemed to move when you tilted it, and written in curly ink were
the words:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>“<b>MAP
OF THE ODD</b><br>
For the finder: April<br>
Your mission: Follow the strange. Trust the peculiar. Avoid the Normal at all
costs.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>Beneath
it was a sketch of April’s neighborhood—but twisted. The tree on Oak Street had
a door. The dog park was labeled “WOLF BALLET AT 4PM.” And there was a dotted
line leading from her house to a giant question mark labeled “???”.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>April
grinned. She grabbed her backpack, stuffed it with jelly beans and a flashlight,
and stepped out the door.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>The
first stop was Mrs. Tweedle’s rose bush, now twice her height and purring
softly. April waved politely. “Excuse me, Rose Beast. I'm following the Map of
the Odd.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>The
roses opened like mouths and whispered, “Bewaaaare the Sidewalk That Bounces.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>April
saluted. “Thanks, talkative shrubbery!” and continued on.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>Sure
enough, the sidewalk one street over began to boing like a trampoline. April
bounced three blocks before landing on a cloud labeled “NOT A CLOUD (Totally a
Flying Muffin).” It carried her to the edge of the Gumdrop Woods, where
squirrels wore monocles and debated politics.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>“Excuse
me,” April asked one squirrel named Professor Nutters, “what’s beyond the Gumdrop
Woods?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>He
straightened his top hat. “You’ll find the Unreadable Library, the Tea Swamp,
and then... The Question Mark.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>April
checked the map. She was on track. “Perfect,” she said, pulling a marshmallow
from a tree branch. “Lead the weird way.”</span></p>

3: The Question Mark</span></b></p></center>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>At
the heart of the Unreadable Library, books floated and danced, opening to pages
that changed every time you blinked. April found a book that told her the
future, the past, and a recipe for invisible pancakes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>The
Tea Swamp was trickier. Talking frogs offered her riddles and tea made of
rainclouds and cinnamon secrets. She answered correctly (“What grows louder the
more you remove?” — “Silence.”) and they gave her a marshmallow boat to cross.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>Finally,
she reached it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>The
Question Mark was a giant door standing alone in the grass. It pulsed with
rainbow light. April touched it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>A
voice echoed: “You’ve followed the Odd. Are you ready to be one with it?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>April
shrugged. “I’ve <i>always</i> been odd. This just made it official.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>The
door opened.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>Inside
was a land of flying cats, upside-down trees, musical sidewalks, and people who
spoke in colors. April stepped in and the door vanished behind her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>The
Map of the Odd fluttered to the ground.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>On
it, new words formed:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>“Odd
is not a place. It’s <i>you.</i> Welcome home, April.”</span></p>
