1: What Is Love, Really?</span></b></p></center>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'><strong><font size=20>L</font></strong>ove.
A simple word with a meaning so vast it stretches across lifetimes. For April
and John, love isn’t just a feeling—it’s a language, a rhythm, a heartbeat
shared between two people who have chosen each other every day, in every way.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>Love
speaks in quiet moments. In the way April glances at John when she’s laughing
too hard to catch her breath. In the way John reaches for her hand,
instinctively, like her presence anchors him. It’s not always loud declarations
or movie-script romance. Sometimes it’s just being there, especially when it’s
hardest.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>Speaking
of love is more than saying &quot;I love you.&quot; It’s showing up. It’s
listening when you’d rather talk. It’s holding each other in storms and still
dancing in the rain.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>In
April and John’s story, love sounds like shared dreams whispered under covers,
inside jokes exchanged with just a look, and forgiveness offered before it’s
even asked for.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>Chapter
2: The Language Between Two Hearts</span></b></p></center>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>Every
love story has its own voice, and April and John have written theirs with every
choice they’ve made together. Love, for them, looks like support through
change, laughter in mundane moments, and growing together instead of apart.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>They’ve
learned each other’s languages—not just words, but silences, expressions,
habits, fears. April knows when John needs space, and John knows when April
needs to be held a little longer. That kind of love doesn’t just happen. It’s
crafted. It’s intentional.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>They
speak love in small things: warm coffee made before the other wakes up, a
midday text just to say, “I’m thinking of you,” or letting the other have the
last piece of dessert, even when they secretly wanted it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>Speaking
of love isn’t just what you say—it's what you do. April and John have found a
way to speak it fluently.</span></p>

3: Always, Again</span></b></p></center>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>There’s
something powerful about choosing someone, again and again. April and John know
that love isn’t always easy—but it’s always worth it. Every morning is a new
beginning, every day a chance to love better, deeper, truer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>They’ve
walked through seasons—some warm and blooming, others cold and uncertain. But
love has been the constant thread, weaving their stories together, page by
page.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>Speaking
of love means believing in tomorrow, even when today is tough. It means
building a life where both hearts feel safe, seen, and cherished.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>For
April and John, love is not just something they speak of. It’s something they
live. And every time they say, “I love you,” they’re really saying, “I choose
you. Still. Always.”</span></p>
