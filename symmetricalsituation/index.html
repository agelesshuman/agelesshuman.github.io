1: The Illusion of Symmetry</span></b></p></center>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'><strong><font size=20>F</font></strong>rom
a distance, many things appear balanced.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>Two
people standing side by side may seem equal—equal in commitment, effort, or
perspective. A conversation may feel like it's evenly shared, a relationship
may look mutual, and a conflict might appear equally caused. But symmetry is
often an illusion we project onto complex situations in order to simplify them,
to make them digestible.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>April
and John, you both have stood in moments where it felt like the ground between
you was level. That each of you was carrying the same weight, pulling the same
rope. But life, emotions, and perspective rarely split down the middle. One
person might be more tired than they let on. One might be giving more than they
receive. One might be more afraid, but quieter about it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>It’s
not about blame. It’s about awareness. Symmetry assumes perfect mirroring—but
humans are not mirrors. We are mosaics of past experiences, hidden fears,
unspoken hopes. And those make everything less equal than it seems on the
surface.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>Chapter
2: Beneath the Surface</span></b></p></center>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>Imagine
a set of scales—not the sleek digital kind, but the old kind with weights and
brass. To the naked eye, the scales may look balanced. But if one side contains
feathers and the other side holds a single pebble with emotional gravity, the
symmetry collapses the moment we really look.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>In
a relationship, like yours, April and John, each person brings their own story.
April might be navigating invisible burdens—overthinking, caretaking, or
dreaming forward. John might be dealing with unspoken expectations, the need
for space, or the quiet pressure of always being “the steady one.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>The
key isn't to force symmetry, but to acknowledge its absence. It’s okay if
things aren’t perfectly even. What matters more is that both of you are willing
to keep looking under the surface. To ask, <i>What don’t I see yet? What might
you be carrying that I haven’t named?</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>True
connection doesn’t come from symmetry. It comes from understanding, from
listening past the easy answers.</span></p>

<div class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>Chapter
3: Moving Forward With Open Eyes</span></b></p></center>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>When
we stop demanding symmetry, we open the door to something deeper: empathy.
Empathy isn't just about standing in each other’s shoes—it’s about realizing
those shoes were never the same size, never walked the same road, and never
will.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>For
April and John, this is your invitation: don’t aim for balance in the obvious
places. Instead, aim for compassion in the subtle ones. Ask questions that
don’t have tidy answers. Make space for the parts of each other that don't
match your own. Give without measuring. Receive without guilt.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>You
are not symmetrical people, and that’s not a problem—it’s a gift. The richness
of your relationship will be found not in matching moves, but in complementary
ones.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>Because
sometimes, the most beautiful dance is not when two people move the same way,
but when they move differently—and still find a rhythm together.</span></p>
