<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'><strong><font size=20>T</font></strong>he
sun usually melted into the ValleyVibes like honey over warm cornbread. Apri
knew this. So did John. That’s why they both froze, mid-step, on the dusty
trail running between the lavender fields and the old jazzwood trees—because
today, something was off.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>“Do
you feel that?” Apri whispered, her hand brushing the soft petals beside her as
if grounding herself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>John
tilted his head, squinting up toward the sun. The sky was still blue—kind of.
But a flicker, like a blink that didn’t belong to any cloud or bird, shimmered
above the hilltops. It wasn’t the sun playing tricks. This flicker had shape.
Rhythm. Almost like it was trying to say something.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>“I
think something just intercepted the sunlight,” John muttered.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>Apri
turned to him, eyes narrowing. “Intercepted?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>“Yeah.
Like... caught it. Or filtered it. Like some invisible mesh passed over the sky
for a second.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>They
stood in silence. Around them, the valley pulsed with soft, natural
sounds—distant hummingbirds, the rustle of wind in jazzwood leaves. But even
those familiar noises felt distant, as if cushioned by something unseen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>Apri
reached into her backpack, pulling out the tiny field lens her grandmother had
given her. “You seeing this or am I losing it?” she asked, handing it over to
John.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>He
peered through the scratched glass, scanning the sky. “There. Above the ridge.
It’s like… a shimmer, but only when you’re not looking directly at it.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>“A
shimmer that avoids eye contact?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>“Exactly.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>Apri
didn’t like the way her heart thudded—like it was syncing up with something
ancient and electrical.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>They
both moved forward, slowly, the path sloping up toward the ridge where the
flicker seemed strongest. The higher they climbed, the more the air felt
strange. It wasn’t cold, but it prickled. Like static before a summer storm.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>Then,
just as they reached the crest, the sky blinked again—clearly this time. A
perfect ellipse of light pulsed once and vanished. The valley held its breath.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>“What
<i>was</i> that?” Apri gasped.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>John
just stared. “I think it… saw us.”</span></p>

5: The Intercept Station</span></b></p></center>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>The
next morning, ValleyVibes woke slow and suspicious. People talked, sure—at the
smoothie stand, on the grassy steps of the music library—but no one could quite
describe what had happened in the sky the day before. It wasn’t viral, not yet.
Just word-of-mouth whispers and eye squints.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>Apri
and John had barely slept. Apri scribbled half the night in her
notebook—sketches of the ellipse, notes about temperature changes, a wild guess
that maybe the shimmer was refracting thought as well as light.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>John
had been digging through his granddad’s old records. He remembered something
about &quot;The Intercept Station&quot;—a term from a weird poem his granddad
once muttered half-asleep on the porch, wrapped in a blanket, watching stars
blink.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>“Intercept
Station?” Apri asked, pouring two cups of moonlight chai from the kettle.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>“Yeah.
He said it was a place—not a building, but a point. A floating point in time.
It appears only when the valley starts remembering too much.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>Apri
raised an eyebrow. “Remembering?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>“Don’t
ask me. He also thought squirrels were time agents, so grain of salt.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>Still,
they followed the hint. They mapped the trajectory of the flicker. It hadn’t
come from above, as they’d assumed. It had <i>risen</i> from the western woods,
near Mirror Lake, where the fog always hung low even on hot days.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>They
packed up supplies: notebooks, chai, flashlights, a synth-compass Apri built
last spring, and a pendant John never took off—his granddad's, a dull coin
engraved with shifting symbols that looked different depending on the light.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>They
reached Mirror Lake by sundown. The water was unusually still, like it had
paused mid-thought. The reflection of the sky above it didn’t match what was <i>actually</i>
in the sky.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>“I
think it’s here,” Apri said, her voice quiet but steady.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>John
nodded. The pendant around his neck vibrated lightly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>Then
they saw it. Not flickering this time—hovering. A shimmer suspended over the
lake, like a jellyfish made of heat and memory. It pulsed softly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>Apri
reached toward it. The synth-compass began spinning in tight, fast circles. The
shimmer flexed like it was exhaling.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>“Are
you sure about this?” John asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>“Nope,”
she said. “But I don’t think it’s here to hurt us.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>Together,
they stepped into the shimmer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>Light
bent. Sound inverted.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>And
just like that—ValleyVibes vanished.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>Or
maybe... it just turned a page.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:18.0pt;line-height:115%'>&nbsp;</span></p>
